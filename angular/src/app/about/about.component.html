                        This is a Hospital Management System built using the 
                        <strong>ASP.NET Boilerplate (ABP)</strong> framework and 
                        <strong>Angular</strong>. It is designed to provide a structured,
                        scalable and maintainable solution for managing hospital operations.

                    <h3>What is this Hospital Management System?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Hospital Management System is an enterprise-style web application
                        that helps manage doctors, patients, admissions, rooms and beds
                        in an organized manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It simplifies administrative tasks such as patient registration,
                        room allocation, bed occupancy tracking and doctor management.
                        The system ensures proper data organization using modern 
                        software development practices.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project follows a clean <strong>N-Layer Architecture</strong>:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Domain Layer</strong> – Entities and business logic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Application Layer</strong> – Application services and DTOs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure Layer</strong> – Repository and database operations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Presentation Layer</strong> – Angular-based user interface.</li>

                    <p>
                        The system also follows <strong>Domain Driven Design (DDD)</strong> principles,
                        ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.
